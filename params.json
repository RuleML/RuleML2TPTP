{"name":"RuleML2TPTP","tagline":"This project is aimed at implementing an XSLT 2.0 translator to convert Deliberation RuleML 1.01 in XML format to an equivalent representation in a subset of the TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) format.","body":"*This is an easy-to-use translator utilizing XSLT 2.0 between two rule languages.*\r\n\r\n### Notice\r\n\r\nThis project was originally developed on [EdmonL/RuleML2TPTP](https://github.com/EdmonL/RuleML2TPTP), but now the development work has been transferred to this repository after version 1.02. The old repository [EdmonL/RuleML2TPTP](https://github.com/EdmonL/RuleML2TPTP) is kept only for reference (like a frozen branch or a tag). The entry page for the old repository is [here](http://edmonl.github.io/RuleML2TPTP/), where the slides and report for the old repository can be obtained.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\n[RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org) is a knowledge representation language developed by the non-profit organization RuleML Inc. RuleML is being used for sharing rule bases in XML and publishing them on the Web. It has broad coverage and is defined as an extensible family of sublanguages across various rule logics and platforms. RuleML consists of [Deliberation RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML) and [Reaction RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Reaction_RuleML). \r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at implementing an [XSLT 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/) translator to convert [Deliberation RuleML 1.01](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML_1.01) in XML format to an equivalent representation in a subset of the (FOF) [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) language.\r\n\r\nFor a documentation page for the joint endeavors of the RuleML and TPTP communities, see [TPTP RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/TPTP_RuleML) on the RuleML wiki. Also see the [readme file](https://github.com/RuleML/RuleML2TPTP) of this project for brief usage.\r\n\r\n### Supported Deliberation RuleML Layers\r\n\r\nThree main expressivity layers of Deliberation RuleML are supported by the following versions:\r\n*  Layer Datalog+: version 1.0x\r\n*  Layer Hornlog+: version 1.1x\r\n*  Layer FOL: version 2.0 and higher\r\n\r\nThe pre-built binaries can be obtained on the [releases page](https://github.com/RuleML/RuleML2TPTP/releases).\r\n\r\n### RuleML Examples\r\n\r\nHere are some good RuleML examples from [RuleML wiki](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML_1.01#Examples) to try with this project.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
